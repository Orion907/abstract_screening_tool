REF001,Effects of Metformin on Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes,This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of metformin therapy on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 120 participants aged 45-65 years with HbA1c levels between 7-10% were randomly assigned to receive either metformin 500mg twice daily or matching placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from baseline. Secondary outcomes included fasting glucose levels and adverse events. Results showed that metformin significantly reduced HbA1c compared to placebo (mean difference -1.2% vs -0.1% p<0.001). The intervention was well tolerated with minimal gastrointestinal side effects.,Include
REF002,Comparative Analysis of Different Surgical Techniques for Appendectomy,This retrospective cohort study compared outcomes between laparoscopic and open appendectomy techniques in patients undergoing appendectomy at a tertiary care hospital. Medical records of 200 patients who underwent appendectomy between 2020-2022 were reviewed. The study included both acute and complicated appendicitis cases. Outcomes measured included operative time surgery duration postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. Results indicated that laparoscopic approach was associated with shorter hospital stays and fewer wound complications compared to open surgery.,Exclude
REF003,Metformin vs Placebo for Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in Pre-diabetic Adults,This double-blind randomized controlled trial investigated whether metformin could prevent progression to type 2 diabetes in adults with pre-diabetes. Participants (n=245) aged 40-70 years with impaired glucose tolerance were randomized to receive metformin 850mg twice daily or matching placebo for 24 months. The primary endpoint was progression to type 2 diabetes as defined by WHO criteria. Secondary endpoints included changes in body weight insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular risk factors. At 24 months metformin reduced diabetes incidence by 31% compared to placebo (HR 0.69 95% CI 0.52-0.91 p=0.009). The drug was well tolerated with no serious adverse events.,Include
REF004,Association Between Coffee Consumption and Cardiovascular Disease Risk,This prospective cohort study examined the relationship between coffee consumption and cardiovascular disease risk in a population of 50000 adults followed for 10 years. Participants completed detailed dietary questionnaires at baseline and were categorized by daily coffee consumption. Primary outcomes included myocardial infarction stroke and cardiovascular death. Results showed a J-shaped association with moderate coffee consumption (3-4 cups per day) associated with lowest cardiovascular risk compared to no consumption or heavy consumption. The study controlled for age sex smoking status and other cardiovascular risk factors.,Exclude
REF005,Efficacy of Metformin in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Treatment,This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of metformin in treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women of reproductive age. The review included 25 randomized controlled trials with a total of 3200 participants comparing metformin to placebo or other treatments. Primary outcomes included ovulation rates menstrual regularity and metabolic parameters. Results demonstrated that metformin significantly improved ovulation rates (RR 1.45 95% CI 1.25-1.68) and reduced insulin resistance compared to placebo. However evidence for improvement in fertility outcomes was limited.,Include
REF006,Impact of Social Media Use on Adolescent Mental Health,This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes in adolescents aged 13-18 years. A total of 1500 students from 10 high schools completed validated questionnaires assessing social media usage patterns depression anxiety and self-esteem. Results showed that heavy social media use (>4 hours daily) was associated with increased rates of depression and anxiety symptoms compared to moderate use. The study also found that passive social media consumption was more strongly associated with negative mental health outcomes than active engagement.,Exclude
